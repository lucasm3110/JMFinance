            <p>At JM3 Finance, we understand that investing in real estate in the United States can come with its own
                set of challenges, such as higher tax burdens and potential issues with property titles. That's why we
                partner with Barbosa Legal to provide customized and comprehensive residential and commercial real
                estate legal services to both local and international investors.<br><br>

                Here's how JM3 Finance, in collaboration with Barbosa Legal, can assist you:<br><br>

                <strong>Real Estate Representation:</strong> Our team considers all possible liabilities and impediments
                to ensure a
                successful investment. Barbosa Legal's experienced attorneys negotiate, structure, and analyze the
                entire transaction, from contract signing to closing. Whether it's residential or commercial, improved
                or unimproved land, we provide the legal expertise needed to navigate the complexities of real estate
                transactions.<br><br>

                <strong>Tax Controversy Assistance:</strong> Dealing with taxing authorities can be overwhelming and
                time-consuming.
                Barbosa Legal represents individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt organizations in tax controversy
                matters before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Florida Department of Revenue, Florida Counties,
                and municipal taxing authorities. We handle all stages of the administrative process, including audits,
                appeals, and even litigating tax disputes in U.S. Tax Court and federal/state courts. Our goal is to
                provide effective solutions while minimizing the stress for our clients.<br><br>

                <strong>Pre-Immigration Tax Planning:</strong> Relocating to the United States requires careful
                consideration of the tax
                implications. Even transactions that may not be taxable in your home country can have tax consequences
                in the U.S. Our team of tax experts at Barbosa Legal provides pre-immigration tax planning strategies to
                help you understand and minimize your tax liability. We ensure that you are well-prepared for the
                financial aspects of becoming a U.S. resident, whether it's for yourself, your family, or your
                business.<br><br>

                <strong>Global Tax Burden Reduction:</strong> Through our pre-immigration tax planning methods, we help
                you anticipate
                and mitigate potential tax implications when relocating to the U.S. Our strategies are designed to
                effectively reduce your global tax burden, ensuring that you optimize your tax position while complying
                with U.S. tax laws.<br><br>

                At JM3 Finance and Barbosa Legal, we are dedicated to providing you with the necessary legal and tax
                expertise to make informed real estate investment decisions in the United States. Our collaborative
                approach ensures that you receive comprehensive support throughout the entire process, from transaction
                analysis to tax planning and resolution of tax controversies. Contact us today to learn more about how
                our services can benefit you when investing in U.S. real estate.<br><br>
